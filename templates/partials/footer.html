                    <p><strong>PADD - Personal Assistant for Daily Documentation</strong></p>

                    <p><em>Or, in Star Trek terms, a "Personal Access Display Device"</em></p>

                    <p>
                        PADD is a simple, local, markdown-based personal information system for capturing and organizing
                        your thoughts, tasks, and knowledge. Like the handheld devices in Star Trek, PADD serves as
                        your personal command center - but instead of managing a starship, you're managing your daily
                        workflow and information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The system uses a simple capture → process → execute → store workflow with three core files
                        and a resources directory:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>inbox.md</code>: Quick capture point for notes, ideas, and tasks - dump everything here without thinking</li>
                        <li><code>active.md</code>: Your dashboard of current commitments - what needs attention now</li>
                        <li><code>daily/</code>: Daily log for activities, thoughts, and reflections - your temporal record</li>
                        <li><code>journal</code>: Personal reflections, ideas, and insights - your private space</li>
                        <li><code>resources/</code>: Organized reference material by topic - where processed information lives long-term</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Workflow:</strong> Everything starts in inbox.md. During regular processing, move items from
                        inbox to either active.md (needs action), resources/ (reference material), or trash. Work from
                        active.md as your command center. When done, move notes to the appropriate resources/ folder.
                        Daily.md captures the journey - what happened and when - as a permanent chronological record.
